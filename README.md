# Exercise: input-and-output-1
* create a class called `PrintYourName`
* provide the class `PrintYourName` with a `main` method:
```
public static void main(String[] args) { ... }
```
* inside the `main` method write the code that prints your name

**Note**: in the console, after your name, you will notice a message like the following:
```
Process finished with exit code 0
```
Don't worry, it means that you didn't break Java, so there were 0 errors :)
